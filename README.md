## This is the Coding Trip
This is where we can practice our skills and knowlegde regarding our previous projects in the ALX S.E
I know, FUN!!


### These Practice questions will involve Pinters, Arraya and Strings because it's what we've covered so far###

##Questions


1, Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string, with certain delimiters used to identify word boundaries

        * The delimeters: \t, \n, ;, ., !, ?, (), {}
        * Prototype: char *cap_string(char *s)
        * You are required to create your own main file
#
#
#
2, Write a program in C that adds spaces between each character in the string and
 accepts a pointer and a string as arguments.
        * Prototype: void addSpaces(char *str, char *)
#
#
3, Write a program that prints a triangle, and takes a pointer as one of it's parameters
	* Prototype: void print_tree(int size, char* tree)
#
#
#
#### That's all for now####
